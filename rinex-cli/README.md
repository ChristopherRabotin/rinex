[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/gwbres/rinex/blob/main/LICENSE-MIT) 

The first purpose of this tool is to expose the [library](https://github.com/gwbres/rinex/rinex) 
in a high level and easy to use fashion.  
The application will be able to parse all RINEX formats supported by the library, refer to its documentation.

The application knows a few `teqc` operations, refer to the
[dedicated paragraph](https://github.com/gwbres/rinex/blob/main/rinex-cli/README.md#teqc-operations)
down below.

This tool will eventually be able to perform most common RINEX 
[post-processing](https://github.com/gwbres/rinex/blob/main/rinex-cli/README.md#post-processing).

## File formats

The application can parse and produce all formats supported by the [library](https://github.com/gwbres/rinex) 

### File naming conventions

File names are disregarded by these tools, you can analyze
& parse files that do not follow naming conventions.

When producing data, this tool will eventually help the user to generate RINEX that follows
naming conventions, but that is currently under development.

### Compressed data

This tool supports gzip compressed files, as long as their name is terminated
by `.gz`, so it can detect the need of invoking the decompression routine.

This tool also supports `CRINEX` (V1, v3) natively, as these declinations
are amonsgt supported formats

## `teqc` operations

`teqc` is a well known application to process RINEX.  

Unlike `teqc`, this application is not capable of processing Binary RINEX ("BINEX") and 
proprietary formats in general.

Here is the list of operations that this tool is capable of performing,
that usually people use `teqc` almost exclusively to perform, to this day

- [merge](https://github.com/gwbres/rinex/blob/main/rinex-cli/README.md#merge)
several RINEX together into a single file.

- [decimate](https://github.com/gwbres/rinex/blob/main/rinex-cli/README.md#decimate)
RINEX record to reduce the quantity of data to analyze

- [split](https://github.com/gwbres/rinex/blob/main/rinex-cli/README.md#split)
given file(s) into two

- [ascii-plot](https://github.com/gwbres/rinex/blob/main/rinex-cli/README.md#ascii-plot)
to print a very descriptive tiny plot in the terminal,
as contained in reports generated by `teqc`

## Graphical view

Graphical view is currently under development is not available at the moment. 
Only terminal / stdout visualization exists to this day.

## Getting started

This application is managed by `cargo`, therefore `cargo build` is the way to build it.

```bash
cargo build
cargo build --release
```

You have two options to invoke the application (command line interface)

- [1] either, at the root of this repo (/rinex), directly invoke the binary that was generated by the previous step
- [2] or, inside the application folder (/rinex/rinex-cli), using `cargo run`

```bash
# [1]
cd ../
./target/debug/rinex-cli --help
./target/release/rinex-cli --help

# [2]
cd rinex-cli
cargo run -- --help
``` 

Command line arguments order does not matter for the application.   
`filepath` is the only mandatory argument, other flags are optional.

Major arguments have an abbreviation:

```bash
cargo run --filepath /tmp/amel010.21g
cargo run -f /tmp/amel010.21g
```

Some arguments support an array of values to be given.
In this case, we use a comma seperated format to describe the values.
Whitespaces are not allowed in the description

```bash
rinex-cli \
     -f test_resources/OBS/V2/rovn0010.21o,test_resources/OBS/V3/DUTH0630.22O
```

## Tool philosophy

Invoke the tool against one or several files.  
Several files might be required based on the operation to perform (`help`).  
All flags are optionnal and can be combined.  
If you request some operation, usually to inspect the internal data (like `epoch` or `sv`),
the tool will not expose the record but will restrict to the requested information.

For example, this command line will expose identified epochs and identified vehicules

```bash
rinex-cli -f /tmp/amel010.21g --epoch --sv
``` 

If no specific data or fields are requested to be displayed, then we expose the record

```bash
rinex-cli -f /tmp/amel010.21g
``` 

Several filtering operations exist, and they can be conbimed to all other operations.  
This applies to all command line arguments terminated by `-filter`.  
For example running this command
will perform the previous operation but on reduced data

```bash
rinex-cli -f /tmp/amel010.21g --epoch --sv-filter R01,G01
``` 

And this command gives a more meaningful record visualization

```bash
rinex-cli --pretty -f test_resources/OBS/V2/amel010.21g \
      --decimate-interval 00:05:00 \
            --sv-filter G01
``` 

When several files are given through `-fp`, we simply apply the previous
to every single file.

## Output format

This tool uses JSON format to expose data, which makes it easy
to import into other tools. The `--pretty` argument is available
and can be combined to all existing flags, to indent the exposed data,
and make it easier to read

```bash
rinex-cli --pretty -f /tmp/amel010.21g \
      --epoch --sv-filter R01,G01 

rinex-cli -f /tmp/amel010.21g \
      --decimate-interval 00:05:00 \
            --sv-filter G01 --pretty
``` 

## Decimate

To reduce the record size, we use decimation

- either by an integer ratio
- or by a minimum epoch interval ("sampling interval") to respect

With this command, we reduce the record size by 2 :
```bash
# print initial epochs
rinex-cli --epoch --pretty -f test_resources/OBS/V2/zegv0010.21o

# reduce by 2
rinex-cli -f test_resources/OBS/V2/zegv0010.21o \
    --decimate-interval 00:01:00 # 1' interval, 00:00:30 epochs get dropped out

# with is actually equivalent to    
rinex-cli -f test_resources/OBS/V2/zegv0010.21o \
       --decimate-ratio 2 # but no knowledge of the resulting "sample" rate 
```

## Epoch events filter

Some RINEX files like Observation Data 
associate an epoch flag to each epoch.  
Filtering on epoch events is an easy and meaningful way to reduce the record size

* --epoch-ok-filter : will only retain valid epochs
* --epoch-nok-filter : will only retain epochs
where the associated flag is not Ok (> 0)

## Satellite vehicule filter

It is possible to filter by constellation or by vehicule of interest

```bash
# display encountered constellations and space vehicules
rinex-cli --constellations --sv \
       -f test_resources/OBS/V2/zegv0010.21o

# focus on Glonnass
rinex-cli  --pretty  --constellation-filter GLO \
             -f test_resources/OBS/V2/zegv0010.21o

# focus on G10, R09 and R08
crinex-cli  --pretty --sv-filter G10,R09,R08 \
     -f test_resources/OBS/V2/zegv0010.21o
```

## Signal condition filters

Observation data might have an "LLI" flag attached to them.
It is possible to apply an And() mask on this field. In this case,
all epochs that did not come with an LLI flag get also dropped out.

In this example, we focus on epochs where a `Loss of Lock` event happened

```shell
rinex-cli --pretty --lli-mask 1 --sv R01 \ 
          -f test_resources/OBS/V2/zegv0010.21o
```

SSI field is another data field that might come with an observation
and it gives the estimated receiver power / SNR at the sampling instant.

It is possible to filter data on minimum signal strength, which
is equivalent to a data "quality" filter

With the following command, we only retain data with SSI >= 5
that means at least 30 dB SNR. 

```shell
rinex-cli --pretty -f test_resources/OBS/V2/zegv0010.21o \
        --ssi-filter 5 --sv-filter R01
```

## Observables

It is possible to filter on "observables", ie., physics or data of interest.

```bash
# list encountered "observables"
rinex-cli -f test_resources/OBS/V3/CBW100NLD_R_20210010000_01D_MN.rnx --observ

# extract raw phase data and pseudo range only
rinex-cli -f test_resources/OBS/V2/zegv0010.21o  \
    --observ-filter C1
```

## Post processing

Some post processing operations are being developped. People usually perform them with tools like `rtklib`.
This application does not aim at matching what `rtklib` is capable of, but it can be a powerful and efficient
alternative to similarly supported operations

## Differential RINEX

Differential RINEX is the operation rnx(a) - rnx(b) where both are Observation RINEX
assumed to be sampled by stationnary and close to each other different receivers.
This simple operation cancels out ionospheric biases.

Provide at least two OBS files for this operation to work.  
Here we differentiante zegv0010.21o using delf0010.21o.  
This is only a command line example, it does not produce anything meaningful because delf0010.21o does not share
any common epoch with zegv0010.21o

```bash
rinex-cli --diff -f test_resources/OBS/V2/zegv0010.21o,test_resources/OBS/V2/delf0010.21o
```

The operation is described in the API [right here](https://docs.rs/rinex/latest/rinex/struct.Rinex.html#method.diff_mut).

## Double Differential RINEX

Double Differential RINEX is first a rnx(a) - rnx(b) operation, previously described,
then another differentiation where we select a reference space vehicule and compute 
the phase difference of other vehicules against this one.

Provide at least two OBS files for this operation to work.  
Here we differentiate zegv0010.21o using delf0010.21o
and dual differentiate zegv0010.21o 

```bash
rinex-cli --ddiff -f test_resources/OBS/V2/zegv0010.21o,test_resources/OBS/V2/delf0010.21o
```

The operation is described in the API [right here](https://docs.rs/rinex/latest/rinex/struct.Rinex.html#method.double_diff_mut).

With this implementation, the user has no mean to select the vehicule that gets designated as the "reference"
in the last differentiation operation. In the implementation, we designate the first vehicule ever encountered
for each constellation, as the reference for the current epoch.

To designate reference vehicules, the user should add a `--ref-sv` list.  
We expect one reference vehicule per constellation encountered in the left over record.  
That means

- if you provide a single reference vehicule, you should make sure you filtered out other
constellations, otherwise data gets dropped out automatically
- if you want to process every single constellation, but forgot to specify a reference vehicule for
one of them, data for this constellation gets dropped out

- there is no mean currently to change the reference vehicule in between epochs,
the reference vehicule will be the designated one across all epochs


## Cycle slips

Possible cycle slip events are described by the GNSS receiver.  
Print such information like this

```bash
rinex-cli --cycle-slips -f test_resources/OBS/V2/zegv0010.21o
```

Cycle slips determination is under development, by adding more data processing on top of the
previously defined Double Differential RINEX algorithm.

## RTK resolution

RTK resolution (rover/base) is under development, by combining the previous double differential RINEX post processing,
and adding a Navigation data analysis on top of it.

## Merge

Merge several RINEX together. We use the `teqc` identifiers to describe the merge operation

```bash
rinex-cli -m -f test_resources/OBS/V2/zegv0010.21o,test_resources/OBS/V2/delf0010.21o
```

This generates a new RINEX file "merged.rnx"

## `Split` special operation

It is possible to split given RINEX files into two.

`Split` has two behaviors

* (1) if given RINEX is a `merged` RINEX (either by `teqc` or this tool),
we split the record at the epoch (timestamps) where records were previously merged

* (2) otherwise, the user is expected to describe a timestamp (`epoch`) 
at which we will split the record.

### Splitting a previously merged record

```bash
# Merge two RINEX together
cargo run -f /tmp/file1.rnx,/tmp/file2.rnx -m --output /tmp/merged.rnx
# Split resulting RINEX
cargon run -f /tmp/merged.rnx --split --output /tmp/split1.rnx,/tmp/split2.rnx 
```

When splitting a merged RINEX, the header section is simply
copied into both results.

### Splitting record

If User provides an `epoch`, the tool will try to locate the
given timestamp and perform `split()` at this date & time.

Two description format are supported, for the user to describe a sampling
timestamp:

* "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS" : Datetime description and EpochFlag::Ok is assumed
* "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS X" : Datetime description where X describes the EpochFlag integer value.
Refer to RINEX standards for supported Epoch flag values 

The tool identifies matching timestamp by comparing the datetime field AND
the flag field. They both must match.

Example :

```bash
# Split a previously merged record
cargo run -f /tmp/merged.rnx --split \
    --output /tmp/file1.rnx,/tmp/file2.rnx

# Split a record at specified timestamp,
# don't forget the \" encapsulation \" ;)
cargo run -f /tmp/data.rnx --split "2022-06-03 16:00:00" \
    --output /tmp/file1.rnx,/tmp/file2.rnx

# Split a record at specified timestamp with precise Power Failure event
# don't forget the \" encapsulation \" ;)
cargo run -f /tmp/data.rnx --split "2022-06-03 16:00:00 1" \
    --output /tmp/file1.rnx,/tmp/file2.rnx
```

## ascii-plot

The ascii-plot emulates the quite interesting tiny plot that `teqc` attaches to its verbose report.

The ascii plot is currently generated for every given Observation RINEX file.

```bash
rinex-cli -f test_resources/OBS/V2/zegv0010.21o --ascii-plot

```

Like other requests, this one cancels the record exposure, with the previous command,
a single tiny plot is to be generated.
