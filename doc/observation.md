# RINEX Observation Data

Observation (OBS) `RINEX` is amongst the two most standard `RINEX` formats.  

Observation files are made of physical measurements:

* `Pseudo Range` estimates (m)
* `Signal Strength` (dBm)
* `Doppler` : doppler shift observation (n.a)
* `Phase` : raw carrier phase measurements (n.a)

that may be avaiable at a certain `epoch` and some may only
be evaluated for specific `sv`.

One example script is provided
```bash
cargo run --example observation
```

## Observation Record content

The OBS record is sorted by `Epoch` and by `Sv`.  
The actual observations (physical measurements) are indexed by using their standard RINEX codes,
refer to their official definition.

Grab an OBS record from a given file:

```rust
let rinex = rinex::Rinex::from_file("observation.rnx")
    .unwrap();
let record = rinex.record
    .unwrap() // record is optional, is None in case of CRINEX
        .as_obs() // observation record cast
        .unwrap();
```

Retrieve all Pseudo Range measurements for one `E04` vehicule
accross all epochs, by using the `L1C` standard code:
```rust
let data = rinex.record
    .iter()
    .map(|(_, sv)| {
    
    })
    .flatten()
    .unwrap();
```
