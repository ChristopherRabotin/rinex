## Parser

`RINEX` files contain a lot of data and this library is capable of parsing most of it.   
To fully understand how to operate this lib, refer to the `RinexType` section you are interested in.

## Production (writer)

`RINEX` file production (writer) is work in progress and will be supported
in next releases

## File naming convention

This parser does not care for the RINEX file name, it is possible to parse a file    
that does not respect standard naming conventions.

### Known weaknesses

* Unusual RINEX files with a unique epoch may not be parsed correctly in some cases
* Only Observation Data V > 2 currently has a format restriction, see dedicated page

## Getting started 

The ``Rinex::from_file`` method parses a local `RINEX` file:

```rust
let rinex = rinex::Rinex::from_file("test_resources/NAV/V2/amel0010.21g")
  .unwrap();
```

The `test_resources/` folder contains short but relevant RINEX files, 
spanning almost all revisions and supported types, mainly for CI purposes.

For data analysis and manipulation, you must refer to the
[official RINEX definition](https://files.igs.org/pub/data/format/)

This [interactive portal](https://gage.upc.edu/gFD/) 
is also a nice interface to discover `RINEX`. 

### Header & general information

The `header` contains high level information.   

```rust
println!("{:#?}", rinex.header);
```

This includes `Rinex`:
* revision number
* GNSS constellation
* possible file compression infos
* recorder & station infos
* hardware, RF infos
* `comments` are exposed in a string array, by order of appearance 
* and much more

```rust
println!("{:#?}", rinex.header.version);
assert_eq!(rinex.header.constellation, Constellation::Glonass)
println!("{:#?}", rinex.header.crinex)
println!("pgm: \"{}\"", rinex.header.program);
println!("run by: \"{}\"", rinex.header.run_by);
println!("station: \"{}\"", rinex.header.station);
println!("observer: \"{}\"", rinex.header.observer);
println!("{:#?}", rinex.header.leap);
println!("{:#?}", rinex.header.coords);
```

## RINEX record

The `Rinex` structure comprises the `header` previously defined,
and the `record` which contains the data payload.

Record data are always classified by `epoch` that means, by sampling timestamps.   
The record is naturally sorted from oldest epochs to newest. 
A `RINEX` file usually spans 24h at a steady sampling interval.   

The `record` is a complex structure of HashMap (_dictionaries_)
whose definition varies with the type of RINEX file.   
Refer to its definition in the API and the specific documentation down below,
for the type of file you are interested in.

`comments` identified in the record are currently dropped out
because they are not considered as `epoch` data directly.   
In the next release, `recods` will be able to expose `comments` 
sorted by `epochs`. This will allow complex post-processing,
and also allow the user to determine what happened in case of special
epoch events.

## `Epoch` object

[Epoch structure](https://docs.rs/rinex/latest/rinex/epoch/index.html)

`epoch` is a `chrono::NaiveDateTime` object validated by an
`EpochFlag`.    
A valid epoch is validated with `EpochFlag::Ok`, refer to specific API.

To demonstrate how to operate the `epoch` API, we'll take 
a Navigation Rinex file as an example. 

First, let's grab the record:

```rust
let rinex = rinex::Rinex::from_file("test_resource/NAV/V2/amel0010.21g")
  .unwrap();
let record = rinex.record
    .as_nav() // NAV record unwrapping
    .unwrap(); // would fail on other RINEX types
```

`epochs` serve as keys of the first hashmap.  
The `keys()` iterator is the easiest way to to determine
which _epochs_ were idenfitied.   
Here we are only interested in the `.date` field of an `epoch`, to determine
the encountered timestamps:

```rust
let epochs: Vec<_> = record
    .keys() // keys interator
    .map(|k| k.date) // building a key.date vector
    .collect();

epochs = [ // epochs are sorted by timestamps 
    2021-01-01T00:00:00,
    2021-01-01T01:00:00,
    2021-01-01T03:59:44,
    2021-01-01T04:00:00,
    2021-01-01T05:00:00,
    ...
]
```

`unique()` to filter `epochs` makes no sense - and is not available,
because a valid RINEX exposes a unique data set per `epoch`.   

For RINEX files that do not expose an Epoch `flag`, like Navigation or Meteo data,
we fix it to `Ok` (valid `epoch`) by default.

Refer to specific
[Observation files documentation](https://github.com/gwbres/rinex/blob/main/doc/observation.md)
to see how filtering using epoch flags is powerful and relevant.

## `Sv` object

`Sv` for Satellite Vehicule, is also 
used to sort and idenfity datasets.  
For instance, in a NAV file,
we have one set of NAV data per `Sv` per `epoch`.

`Sv` is tied to a `rinex::constellation` and comprises an 8 bit
identification number.

## Useful high level methods

* `interval`: returns the nominal sampling interval - nominal time difference
between two successive epochs in this `record`. See API for more information
* `sampling_dead_time`: returns a list of `epochs` for which time difference
between epoch and previous epoch exceeded the nominal sampling interval.

### Advanced `RINEX` file operations

Advanced operations like file Merging will be available in next releases.   
Merged `RINEX` files will be parsed properly: meaning the `record` is built correctly.   
Informations on the `merging` operation will be exposed either in the `.comments` structure,
if "standard" comments were provided.

## Specific documentation

Documentation and example of use for specific `RINEX` formats

+ [Observation Data](https://github.com/gwbres/rinex/blob/main/doc/observation.md)
+ [Meteo Data](https://github.com/gwbres/rinex/blob/main/doc/meteo.md)

## Work in progress

Topics to be unlocked by next releases

* RINEX file production : provide `to_file` methods
to produce supported RINEX formats
* RINEX Clock data type
* RINEX special operations like `merging` when producing a new file
* Merging + compression for OBS data
