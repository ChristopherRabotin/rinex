Rust tool suites to parse, analyze, manipulate `RINEX` files

* [rinex](rinex/) RINEX file parsing & production, core library

* [crx2rnx](crx2rnx/) is a command line application to decompress a `CRINEX` file

* [sinex](sinex/) SINEX special files parser, core library

* [rinex-cli](rinex-cli/) is a command line application
to analyze data and perform operations (like `teqc`) on `RINEX`, `CRINEX` 
and soon `SINEX` files

* [ublox-rnx](ublox-rnx) is an application that connects to a `Ublox`
receiver and generates Observation and Navigation Data easily.
It is based on the [ublox](https://github.com/lkolbly/ublox) crate.

* `rnx2crx`: `RINEX` file compressor is currently under development,
see `develop` branches

## Supported RINEX revisions

* 1.00 ⩽ v < 4.0    Tested 
*             v = 4.0    refer to file type specific pages

## Supported `RINEX` files

The following RINEX files are currently supported:

* `Type::NavigationData` (NAV) data
* `Type::ObservationData` (OBS) data
* `Type::MeteoData` (MET) data
* `Type::ClockData`: (CLK) RINEX: under development
* `Type::AntennaData`: (ATX) RINEX: under development

## CRINEX special case

CRINEX V1 and V3 are fully supported.   
CRINEX V2 does not exist.  

You can directly pass to the parser Observation `RINEX` files that were compressed with 
the `RNX2CRX` official tool.

## Features

* `--with-serde` to enable `Serialization` and `Deserialization`,
useful for applications that need to parse / control some of the
RINEX attributes. 

## Coming in next releases

* Improved Clocks RINEX support
* Merge / Splice / Split record special operations
* Antex (ATX) RINEX parsing
