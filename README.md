Rust tool suites to parse, analyze, manipulate `RINEX` files

* [`rinex`](rinex/) `RINEX` file parsing & production and `teqc` similar ops, 
this is the core library

* [`crx2rnx`](crx2rnx/) is a command line application to decompress `CRINEX` files

* [`sinex`](sinex/) `SINEX` files parser, core library

* [`rinex-cli`](rinex-cli/) is a command line application
to analyze data and perform operations (like `teqc`) on `RINEX`, `CRINEX` 
and soon `SINEX` files

* [`ublox-rnx`](ublox-rnx) is an application (CLI) that connects to a `Ublox`
receiver and generates RINEX data quickly & easily.
It is made possible by combining the [ublox](https://github.com/lkolbly/ublox) crate
and [`rinex`](rinex/) library core.

* `rnx2crx`: `RINEX` file compressor is currently under development,
see `develop` branches

`trusted`: means under CI/CD, user can parse safely   
`untrusted`: means not under CI/CD, either due to lack of test data, partial (:construction:) or incomplete support   

Notes on `V4`: 
- marked as `untrusted` to this day, due to lack of data
- there's a good chance OBS/NAV/MET will work, because format is actually simpler
and parser has been coded.  
:arrow_right_hook: Data, tests and contributions are welcomed

**Production** means file generation (_to_file()_) of `trusted` revisions  
**CLI** means exposed to [`rinex-cli`](rinex-cli/) for easy parsing & quick analysis  
**UBX** means exposed to [`ublox-rnx`](ublox-rnx/) for to produce data with a UBLOX receiver  

:heavy_check_mark: supported   
:heavy_minus_sign: not applicable   
:construction: under development

## Features

* `--with-serde`   
enables `Serialization` and `Deserialization` of key RINEX structures

<img align="right" width="400" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/SBAS_Service_Areas.png">

* `--with-geo`   
will be provided in 0.4.0. The feature
includes the `rust::geo` crate, 
and unlocks the    
`augmentation::sbas_selection_helper()` method,
to select the most appropriate `SBAS` augmentation system for
a given (usually current..) location on Earth.
See [constellation](doc/constellation.md) for example of use.

* `--with-gzip`  
to be provided in future, allows parsing .gz compressed RINEX files directly

## Contributions

Contributions, raw data and tests methods are welcomed.  
There is still a lot to achieve with this lib, especially regarding the command line applications (high level usage of the library cores).

### Introducing new RINEX types

Follow the existing architecture:

* introduce `types::Type::foo`
* provide new `record::Record` declination
* create `rinex/src/foo` sub directory and provide at least a rinex/src/foo/record.rs for the file body
* add new specific header fields if need be, define them in `rinex/src/foo`
* attach unit tests to the new `rinex/src/foo` structures & methods
* provide relevant (but truncated, to keep repo size reasonnable) raw data, under `test_resources/`
* add new type to `test_resources` testbench in `tests/parser.rs`
* add a focused testbench, in `tests/foo.rs` with specific fields test

### Adding more RINEX data

* only introduce non existing RINEX declinations
* truncate huge files to maintain a reasonnable repo size
